# Perform Basic Operations like addition,subtraction,multiplication,divide by taking two number as user input
num1=float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2=float(input("Enter the second number: "))

Addition=int(num1)+int(num2)
Subtraction=int(num1)-int(num2)
Multiplication=int(num1)*int(num2)
Division=int(num1)/int(num2)

print("Addition: ",Addition)
print("Subtraction: ",Subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ",Multiplication)
print("Division: ",round(Division,2))
